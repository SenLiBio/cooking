# 1 Braised Pork Chops with Scallions

1. **Ingredients**: About 500g pork chops (slightly fatty cuts preferred), 1 egg, around 300g scallions, ginger, sugar, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, white pepper, starch, and oil.
    
2. Slice the pork chops into thick pieces (around 1 cm). If there is a membrane ring, cut it to prevent shrinking during frying. Pound the meat to flatten and expand it by about 1.5 times. Cut scallions into small segments, smash the white parts. Slice and smash ginger. Add some hot water to parts of the scallion whites and ginger to extract their juice.
    
3. Beat the egg and mix with the pork chops, scallion-ginger juice, salt, white pepper, and dark soy sauce. Add starch and mix well. Add oil to lock in moisture.
    
4. Heat oil in a pan, fry the pork chops on high heat for 10 to 20 seconds on each side, depending on thickness. Drain oil and set aside.
    
5. If there is too much oil in the pan, pour some out and leave a small amount. Add ginger to sauté, then add scallion whites to fry. Layer a large amount of scallion greens in the pan and place the pork chops on top. Add water to cover the chops (including any leftover scallion-ginger juice). Add a bit of sugar, dark soy sauce for color, and oyster sauce. No extra salt needed unless desired. Cover and cook on high for about 10 minutes. Uncover and reduce the sauce until thickened. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.
    

# 2 Braised Beef with Potatoes
